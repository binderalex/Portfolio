        <h4 style="text-align:center;">Product Design & User Research</h4>
        </br>
        <p>During my tenure at <a href="https://www.onshift.com/"> OnShift</a> I inherited a tool designed for retirement home managers to recruit hourly staff. I joined a small team comprised of a few engineers and a product manager one quarter before our major release. This case study will summarize a few key features we worked on to take this niche recruitment tool from beta to V1 and beyond.</p>

      <h2> Why SMS based recruiting?</h2>

      <p>Nursing homes, on average, hold one of the highest turn over rates across most industries in the USA. This stat has led to a major skilled worker shortage in this industry.  In the USA post acute care facilities (nursing homes) need a certain worker to patient ratio for these facilities to stay open legally. OnShift’s answer to this problem was a recruiting tool that let enables recruiters to respond to many applicants quickly and conveniently via an SMS chatbot that would schedule and set up interview times.</p>
      </br>
      <h2>Crafting a feature list… quickly.</h2>
      <h4>Creating a long term backlog in three months</h4>
    <p>When I joined the team most of the work on the chat bot was already completed by a designer that just left OnShift. So it was my job to help the team evaluate the rest of the product to determine what we needed to prioritize before our first major release. A lot of the research and execution for our feature list was done quickly in collaboration with my lead engineer, my product manager and our 8 beta partners. (nursing homes testing our product)  We took weekly visits out to each nursing home where we ran contextual inquiries, observations and usability testing to make sure we were on the right track. The following represents the output from this process:</p>

      <h2> The Crux of the Problem </h2>
      <h4> Redesigning App Nav </h4>
      <p>
        With the insights gained from our interviews we realized why the previous app was missing the mark.
      </p>
    </br>
      <p>
        The previous navigation pattern negatively impacted usability. It used a hub style navigation model that shows the clinician everything at once. This created decision fatigue resulting in clinicians picking options in an order that didn't align with how they work with their patients.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Because of this, most clincians started therapy sessions, entered arbitrary calbration numbers and used the device improperly. Or even worst, abandoned the device all together half way through a session to finish the process manually.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="contentblock">
      <h2> The Solution </h2>

      <h4> Guiding Clinicians with Progressive Disclosure Techniques </h4>
      <p> The wireframe below shows the redesigned navigation pattern. The left branch shows the automated calibration process. While the right side shows the manual process for expert clinicians. Read more below. </p>
    </div>

      <img src="Images/NewNavWireframes.png">

      <div class="contentblock">
        <p>
          To reduce ambiguity we emphasize what most clinicians should do when they start a therapy session, calibrate the device to the patients muscle strength. Once the clinician finishes the calibration process we use that data to set up a custom difficulty level for therapy games.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          To save time for other activities, some expert clincians log previous calibrations in a journal outside the app and enter calibrations manually when they begin the therapy session. The navigation pattern displayed above still supports this use case as well. These expert clinicians use the calibration tool as a bench mark for how well their patient is doing week to week. This weekly process is technically refered to as a trial. We renamed the calibration context to “Trials” to make the step more meaningful to clinicians.
        </p>
    </div>

      <div class="contentblock">
        <h2>Trials Mode</h2>
        <h4>Previously Calibration Mode</h4>
        <p> Trials mode is designed to do two things. It provides some baseline information about the patient’s muscle strength for the clinician. It also calibrates a custom difficulty setting for physical therapy games. </p>
      </div>

      <img src="Images/TrialsMode.png">

      <div class="caption">
        <h4> Clinicians can toggle between two different modes depending on their patient's coordination and strength"</h4>

      <div class="contentblock">
        <h3>Timed vs Self-Paced</h3>
        <p>
          There are two different trials modes designed to get the same kind of calibration info. Timed is the default mode. Over a 30 second period of time a patient’s swallowing strength is measured via the Aspire device and displayed on the iOS device.
        </p>
      </br>
        <p>
          For the majority of patients, "Timed Mode" meets their needs. However, the problem with "Timed Mode" is that it makes the assumption that all patients with dysphagia can swallow enough times (within 30 seconds) for the device to present relevant results. We introduced another mode called “Self-Paced” designed to let clinician and patient calibrate the device at their own pace.

        <h2> Poor Error Prevention </h2>
        <h4> The Setup Process </h4>
        <p>
          Based on the stakeholder interviews we conducted earlier and observation during our private beta. One of the largest blockers for clinicians using the companion app was the setup process right before starting a trial or game session.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The setup process involved various steps that must be completed in a specific sequence. This process required clinicians to bounce between:

          <div class="PhotoBlock">
            <h1 class="pattern">3</h1>
            <p> Then hitting the play button on said Aspire Device</p>

        <div class="PhotoBlock">

          <p> Then going back to their phone or tablet and starting up the trial or game</p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <h3> Solution </h3>
    <h4> The Setup Checklist </h4>
    <p>
      We found that the best way to handle these errors was to run a check right when the user hits the start button to make sure all of the proper conditions were met. If one of these conditions were not met we would launch a wizard that takes the clinician through the setup process step by step.

    <h2> Error State System </h2>
    <h4> Illustration System </h4>
      <p>
        There were multiple places where this style of error occurs through out the app. So this provided an opportunity to come up with a cohesive illustration system to help guide clinicians through the set up process.
      </p>
    </br>
      <p>
        The goal was to use on-brand accent colors to highlight the parts of the device clinicians should focus on.

    <h2> Physical Therapy Games</h2>
    <p>
      Once the app is calibrated the home screen presents the option to play games that can be controlled with the Aspire device. Currently there is only one game available but Spectramed has plans to add additional games in the future.

    <h2> Turning Clients into Game Designers </h2>
    <h4> Keeping Clients Focused </h4>
    <p>
      When we first started working with the Spectramed team they were very enthusiastic about the opportunity to design games for their customers. They had a lot of great ideas. But to keep them focused I facilitated a workshop with their clinicians on staff and we talked about the goals clinicians have for their therapy patients. We were able to organize those goals into three buckets. This framework helped drive our decision for what games made the backlog verses the games that didn’t make the cut. So for example the paper plane game hit two out of three therapy goals so we launched with it.

      Come back here for more updates if you liked what you saw. I will update this page with more of the games as we release.

            <h2> Getting Results </h2>
            <h4> Reducing Support Calls </h4>



              <p>
                Spectramed is a relatively small company, so much so that they only have 1 full-time staff member responsible for training and onboarding nurses and physical therapists. This person also serves as their lone tech support rep. This means if a user has a problem with the product they call her cell phone. Before the redesign, she receives roughly 3-4 support calls per day.  The majority of their calls were related to in-app discoverability issues. Most of these calls come from one of their largest facility. When we ran a beta test with 80% of the facility's users. 3 weeks after making the last of the changes, <strong style="color:#035d94;"> we saw a decline in support calls from 3-4 per day to 1-2 per week.</strong> None of the calls received were related to the new navigation or usability. This behavior change hit our primary KPI of reducing support calls without requiring any additional training. We suspect that these improvements will enable the company to scale without hiring an additional support person for the time being.
