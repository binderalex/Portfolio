        </br>
        <p>During my tenure at <a href="https://www.onshift.com/"> OnShift</a> I inherited a tool designed for retirement home managers to recruit hourly staff. I joined a small team comprised of a few engineers and a product manager one quarter before our major release. This case study will summarize a few key features we worked on to take this niche recruitment tool from beta to V1 and beyond.</p>

      <h2> Why SMS based recruiting?</h2>

      <p>On average nursing homes hold some of the<a href="https://www.advisory.com/research/post-acute-care-collaborative/members/toolkits/2018/the-guide-to-reducing-turnover-in-post-acute-care?WT.ac=Inline_PACC_Toolkit_x_x_x_ATH_2020Mar10_Eloqua-RMKTG+Blog"> highest turn over rates</a> across most industries in the USA. This stat has led to a major skilled worker shortage in this industry.  In the USA post acute care facilities (nursing homes) need a certain worker to patient ratio for these facilities to stay open legally. OnShift’s answer to this problem was a recruiting tool that let enables recruiters to respond to many applicants quickly and conveniently via an SMS chatbot that would schedule and set up interview times.</p>

      <h2>Fast and furious planning</h2>
      <h4>Creating a long term backlog in three months</h4>
    <p>When I joined the team most of the work on the chat bot was already completed by a designer that just left OnShift. So it was my job to help the team evaluate the rest of the product to determine what we needed to prioritize before our first major release. A lot of the research and execution for our feature list was done quickly in collaboration with my product team and our 8 beta partners. (nursing homes testing our product)  We took weekly visits out to each nursing home where we ran contextual inquiries, observations and usability testing to make sure we were on the right track. My team and I accomplished a lot in a short time but the following solutions represent my most impactful contributions to the product.</p>

      <h2> Revamping the Candidate list </h2>
      <h4> Refining a flashy piece of tech </h4>
      <p>
        During contextual inquiries we uncovered that recruiters were using this candidate list to keep track of applicants way more than we thought. Recruiters would come in each morning and add new applicants from their Indeed listing. Then they would check the list displayed below to see if anyone responded to them overnight.
      </p>
    </div>
    <img src="Images/CandidateHierarchy.png">
    </br>
    <div class="caption">
      <h4> Instead of seeing a list of candidates they actually cared about, recruiters would see anywhere from 10-20 candidates they just texted at the top of their list. This issue made recruiters miss ~5-10 engaged candidates per day. </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="contentblock">
      <p>
        The original order of this list, newest ➡️ oldest candidates, made it extremely difficult for recruiters to keep track of candidates who either needed to reschedule their interview or leave any feedback on candidates they've recently interviewed. The team originally thought that recruiters would use the "Interviews" tab to manage candidates this way. But seeing recruiters gravitate towards the "candidates" view even though it was difficult to use told us that our perception of their mental model was incorrect. So we thought it was important to make sure we exposed features that let recruiters manage their candidates easily straight from this list. Because if recruiter couldn’t keep track of who they reached out too, then this fancy chatbot that increased applicant volume would be worthless.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="contentblock">
      <h2> The Solution </h2>

      <h4> Highlighting mission critical candidates </h4>
      <p> The solution we landed on was a filtering system modeled after our recruiters' interview process. We organized candidates being actively considered for a position into chronological buckets based on where they were in the recruitment process. Read more below. </p>
    </div>

      <img src="Images/CandidateListRedesign.png">
      <div class="caption">
        <h4> We used the real estate at the top ofthe screen highlighting two different kinds of candidates. Candidates who needed to reschedule and candidates that an HR person has just finished interviewing.</h4>

      <div class="caption">
        <h4> Here is the default state of the candidate list. We only reserved higher contrast colors for when we actually needed to catch a recruiters attention.</h4>
      </div>
</br>
</br>
      <img src="Images/CandidateFilterList.gif">

      <div class="contentblock">
        <p>
        Before releasing this feature recruiters would miss, on average, 5 to 6 candidates every day because they had issues scheduling an interview with the chatbot. Highlighting candidates this way reduced missed candidates to nearly 0 with our beta group. We planned to follow up this feature SMS notification post beta.

        <h2>Trials Mode</h2>
        <h4>Previously Calibration Mode</h4>
        <p> Trials mode is designed to do two things. It provides some baseline information about the patient’s muscle strength for the clinician. It also calibrates a custom difficulty setting for physical therapy games. </p>
      </div>

      <img src="Images/TrialsMode.png">


      <div class="caption">

      <div class="contentblock">
        <h3>Timed vs Self-Paced</h3>
        <p>
          There are two different trials modes designed to get the same kind of calibration info. Timed is the default mode. Over a 30 second period of time a patient’s swallowing strength is measured via the Aspire device and displayed on the iOS device.
        </p>
      </br>
        <p>
          For the majority of patients, "Timed Mode" meets their needs. However, the problem with "Timed Mode" is that it makes the assumption that all patients with dysphagia can swallow enough times (within 30 seconds) for the device to present relevant results. We introduced another mode called “Self-Paced” designed to let clinician and patient calibrate the device at their own pace.

        <h2> Poor Error Prevention </h2>
        <h4> The Setup Process </h4>
        <p>
          Based on the stakeholder interviews we conducted earlier and observation during our private beta. One of the largest blockers for clinicians using the companion app was the setup process right before starting a trial or game session.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The setup process involved various steps that must be completed in a specific sequence. This process required clinicians to bounce between:

          <div class="PhotoBlock">

      </div>

    <h3> Solution </h3>
    <h4> The Setup Checklist </h4>
    <p>
      We found that the best way to handle these errors was to run a check right when the user hits the start button to make sure all of the proper conditions were met. If one of these conditions were not met we would launch a wizard that takes the clinician through the setup process step by step.

    <h2> Error State System </h2>
    <h4> Illustration System </h4>
      <p>
        There were multiple places where this style of error occurs through out the app. So this provided an opportunity to come up with a cohesive illustration system to help guide clinicians through the set up process.
      </p>
    </br>
      <p>
        The goal was to use on-brand accent colors to highlight the parts of the device clinicians should focus on.

    <h2> Turning Clients into Game Designers </h2>
    <h4> Keeping Clients Focused </h4>
    <p>
      When we first started working with the Spectramed team they were very enthusiastic about the opportunity to design games for their customers. They had a lot of great ideas. But to keep them focused I facilitated a workshop with their clinicians on staff and we talked about the goals clinicians have for their therapy patients. We were able to organize those goals into three buckets. This framework helped drive our decision for what games made the backlog verses the games that didn’t make the cut. So for example the paper plane game hit two out of three therapy goals so we launched with it.

            <h2> Getting Results </h2>
            <h4> Reducing Support Calls </h4>



              <p>
                Spectramed is a relatively small company, so much so that they only have 1 full-time staff member responsible for training and onboarding nurses and physical therapists. This person also serves as their lone tech support rep. This means if a user has a problem with the product they call her cell phone. Before the redesign, she receives roughly 3-4 support calls per day.  The majority of their calls were related to in-app discoverability issues. Most of these calls come from one of their largest facility. When we ran a beta test with 80% of the facility's users. 3 weeks after making the last of the changes, <strong style="color:#035d94;"> we saw a decline in support calls from 3-4 per day to 1-2 per week.</strong> None of the calls received were related to the new navigation or usability. This behavior change hit our primary KPI of reducing support calls without requiring any additional training. We suspect that these improvements will enable the company to scale without hiring an additional support person for the time being.
