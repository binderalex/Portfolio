        <p>During my time on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook app</a>  I fo cused on building new product experiences for community members to interact with each other and admin management tools. Below are two notable projects that I led or co-led with designers across Facebook app.</p>

      <h2> New Member Greeting</h2>

      <p>New member greeting was one feature from a larger initative that I led to give admins more control over how they onboard new member. This was a 0-1 project designed to reduce manual admin enforcement events by giving them the ability to establish group norms for new members when they first join a group. As of August of 2022 this feature was rolled out to 100% of admins. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/facebook-groups-to-gain-personalization-features-subgroups-chat-and-tools-for-making-money/"> Read more about this feature and other groups customization tools.</a> </p>

    <h2>Recommendations in Groups</h2>

    <p> I co-led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/facebook-launches-shops-in-groups-and-live-shopping-for-creators/">redesign of product and location recommendations</a> across facebook groups with designers across News Feed and Marketplace. Facebook users have always leveraged friends in their social graph and interest groups for recommendations on new things to try or purchase. And with the addition of new shopping features on Facebook we thought there could be an opportunity to bring a unique question asking and browsing experience to Facebook groups. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristyokada/">Kristy Okada</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-defrancesco/"> Chris Defrancisco </a> and I put together a series of test to find out if we optimized our recommendation experience for groups already exhibiting question asking behavior, could we increase the volume and quality of questions being asked on FB app today?</p>
