        </br>
        <p>During my tenure at <a href="https://www.joinroot.com/"> Root Insurance Co.</a>  I've led design across two problem areas, checkout and policyholder experience. Below are two notable products that I took from conception to execution during my tenure at Root.</p>

      <h2> Stay Home Driving Bonus</h2>

      <p>I had the pleasure of working on Root's Stay Home Driving Bonus. A program designed to reward our policyholders for staying home and reducing the spread of Covid-19. Policyholders who let us track their telematics during the months of April and May could receive up to 10% of their premium back for driving less than they normally would.
This is the reward flow I designed for customers who received the largest refund. This flow was only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the work required to get this out the door.</p>

    <h2> Right Quote Recommendations</h2>

    <p>I lead design on a coverage recommendation engine designed to make it easier for first time insurance buyers to understand the insuranceâ€‹ they need. From Q2-Q4 2019 this work earned and additional $250,000 in weekly revenue. </p>
